# Next Steps - Blog Series Development

## 🎯 Immediate Next Session Tasks

### 1. Review the Outlines
- [ ] Read through README.md and SERIES_OUTLINE.md
- [ ] Review individual post outlines in `/posts/`
- [ ] Identify any adjustments or refinements needed
- [ ] Confirm the narrative flow makes sense

### 2. Choose Your First Post
Which topic excites you most to write first?

**Options:**
- **Post 1** (Case for Local AI) - Great starting point, sets the stage
- **Post 2** (Apple Silicon Benchmarks) - Has concrete data, exciting
- **Post 4** (Bluey Chatbot) - Fun, engaging, shows personality work
- **Post 5** (Semantic Search) - Practical, weekend project appeal
- **Post 8** (Test-Driven Development) - Show professional practices

**Recommendation**: Start with Post 1 or Post 4 (most engaging hooks)

### 3. Gather Assets for First Post
Depending on which post you choose, collect:

#### For Post 1 (Case for Local AI):
- [ ] Cost comparison data (cloud vs local)
- [ ] Timeline of Apple Silicon AI milestones
- [ ] Screenshots from your projects
- [ ] Performance metrics

#### For Post 2 (Apple Silicon Benchmarks):
- [ ] Actual training times from gemma-local-finetune
- [ ] Memory usage during training
- [ ] Inference speed measurements
- [ ] Embedding generation speeds from embeddinggemma
- [ ] Terminal output screenshots

#### For Post 4 (Bluey Chatbot):
- [ ] Review bluey_dataset.jsonl
- [ ] Test current fine-tuned model
- [ ] Collect example conversations
- [ ] Document before/after comparisons
- [ ] Training logs/output

#### For Post 5 (Semantic Search):
- [ ] Create embedding visualization diagram
- [ ] Run example queries and capture results
- [ ] Performance comparison (grep vs semantic)
- [ ] Cache structure examples
- [ ] Code walkthrough screenshots

#### For Post 8 (Test-Driven Development):
- [ ] Test output screenshots
- [ ] Coverage reports
- [ ] CSRF bug before/after code
- [ ] Linting statistics over time
- [ ] PostgreSQLTestCase code

### 4. Start Drafting
Once you've chosen a post and gathered assets:
- [ ] Create first draft in `/drafts/` folder
- [ ] Follow the outline structure
- [ ] Include code snippets with explanations
- [ ] Add placeholders for images/diagrams
- [ ] Write conversationally (show the journey)

### 5. Optional: Create Visual Assets
- [ ] Architecture diagrams (draw.io, Excalidraw, or Mermaid)
- [ ] Performance charts (spreadsheet graphs)
- [ ] Code annotation images
- [ ] Terminal output screenshots with highlights

## 🎨 Writing Resources

### Style Reminders:
- Start with a compelling hook (question, story, problem)
- Show your journey (include failures, not just wins)
- Use concrete numbers (5-minute training, 740 tests, 30% compression)
- Keep code snippets focused (15-20 lines max with comments)
- End with actionable takeaway
- Link to previous/next posts

### Post Structure Template:
1. **Hook** (50-100 words) - Grab attention
2. **Context** (100-150 words) - Set up the problem
3. **Solution/Story** (400-500 words) - Main content
4. **Results** (100-150 words) - What happened
5. **Lessons** (100-150 words) - What you learned
6. **Takeaway + CTA** (50-100 words) - Next steps
