# Post 1: The Case for Local AI - Why I'm Building Without Cloud GPUs

**Status**: Not Started
**Target Word Count**: 800-1000 words (~4 min read)
**Publish Date**: TBD

## Hook

"What if I told you that you could train AI models, run semantic search, and deploy chatbots entirely on your Mac?"

## Key Points

- The problems with cloud AI (cost, privacy, lock-in, latency)
- The promise of local AI (ownership, privacy, no limits, instant iteration)
- What changed to make this possible (Apple Silicon, open models, better tooling)
- Real results from my projects
- Preview of what's coming in the series

## Projects Referenced

- gemma-local-finetune (local training)
- embeddinggemma (semantic search)
- Overview of the portfolio

## Key Metrics to Include

- Cost savings: specific dollar amounts
- Training times: "5-minute training runs"
- Time savings: "weekend build"

## Assets Needed

- [ ] Cost comparison chart (cloud vs local)
- [ ] Timeline graphic of Apple Silicon + AI
- [ ] Preview screenshots from projects
- [ ] Performance comparison table

## Code Snippets

None needed for this post (philosophy/overview)

## Takeaway

Local AI is not just possible—it's practical, cost-effective, and ready for real work.

## Call to Action

"In the next post, I'll show you the actual benchmarks from my M4 Max..."

## SEO Keywords

## Writing Notes

- Keep it accessible - this is the entry point
- Focus on problems readers face
- Build excitement for the series
- Use concrete examples, not abstract benefits
- Address skepticism head-on
